# Django Starter

This is a short python script that creates a conda environment, download the current version of Django within the environment, create a Django project, and start the server.

## Installation

Visit [Anaconda.org's distribution page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and download to your native Operating System, then copy this script into the directory that you'd like to hold all of your Django projects in.

## Usage

```bash
python django_starter.py
```
This will create a conda environment in your /Users/{username}/Anaconda3/envs/ directory with the same name that you'll pass in. It will also create a subdirectory in your current working directory to hold your django project with the same name.

## Contributing
